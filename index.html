    <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>My name is Matthew Salyer.</p> <p>I graduated from Campbellsville University in 2015 with a degree in music education. I enjoyed my time in the band director world but the COVID pandemic was a
    wake-up call for me. <p>While I enjoyed teaching, I never loved it. That is until I was able to do it from home full time.
        Going back into the classroom put me in a panic, and I knew I couldn't do any more time of a job I was not passionate about.</p>
    <p><h2>Enter coding.</h2>
      <p> Software and Web Development excited me with the opportunity to think critically and solve problems. Where the
      education world is fast pace and full of thousands of micro-decisions every day, in development I get to sit down and
      notice all the trees in the forest. </p>
